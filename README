Before running the unit tests, you need to configure MarkLogic with one initial
application server, from this, the Unit test scripts will be able to prepare all
other databases, forests, Documents, indexes and Application Servers necessary for
the CORB TestSuite.

=======================================================
The initial application server should be set up as such:
=======================================================
Port 			- 8020
Database DB 	- your-test-db
Modules DB		- Modules

Please note that no updates should occur in either the Documents or Modules DBs; this application server is just configured to give enough access to create the necessary
resources required by the test suite.

TODO - Create initial servers and add the no_user script:
